# BitMagic C - language wrapper for BitMagic C++ 

BitMagic C lib is a wrapper for [BitMagic C++](https://github.com/tlk00/BitMagic).

The goal of this project is to provide portable C bit-vector APIs for integration with other languages.
Intention is to create build which would not use C++ excptions, new and other features dependencies 
on C++ runtime.


## Contribution and help

Looking for a freelance contributor to evaluate build on various compiler/OS platforms.
